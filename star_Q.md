# STAR Interview Questions for PEP Matching ML System

The STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) framework is commonly used in interviews to assess a candidate’s skills and experience via behavioral questions. Below are STAR interview questions specifically tailored for the development, deployment, and maintenance of a Politically Exposed Person (PEP) matching machine learning system.

---

## 1. **Situation**
- Tell me about a time when you needed to build a system for screening customers against a complex compliance list like PEPs. What challenges did you encounter with the data sources and business requirements?
- Describe a scenario in which a client requested a robust AML solution with low false positives. What was your understanding of the problem?

## 2. **Task**
- What was your specific role in developing or improving a PEP screening or entity matching solution? What goals or KPIs were you responsible for?
- Can you share a situation where you had to define matching logic or feature engineering criteria for a regulatory project? What requirements did you need to fulfill?

## 3. **Action**
- How did you design the feature set for the PEP matching model? What attributes did you consider and why?
- Walk me through your approach to minimizing false positives while maintaining high sensitivity in PEP identification.
- What steps did you take to handle ambiguous or incomplete data (e.g., missing DOB, name variations, transliterations)?
- Can you describe how you leveraged external libraries (like `fuzzywuzzy`) or ML techniques (e.g., GradientBoostingClassifier) in your solution?
- How did you validate or test your model’s performance? What metrics did you use, and how did you tune your approach?
- Describe a time when you had to implement business rule-based logic alongside machine learning. How did you integrate the two approaches?
- What was your strategy to update the model when new matching criteria or risk factors were introduced by compliance teams?

## 4. **Result**
- What was the outcome of your PEP matching solution? How did it impact business processes or compliance reporting?
- Can you share quantitative results (e.g., reduction in false positives, improved true match rate) from your implementation?
- How did your work improve customer onboarding or ongoing monitoring for financial institutions?
- What did you learn from deploying the system to production? Any feedback or improvements made post-launch?

## **Bonus: Technical Deep Dive**

- How would you scale the PEP matching system for millions of daily customer screenings?
- What challenges might arise when integrating with real-time transaction monitoring or batch processing workflows?
- If tasked to add new features like sanctions list matching or relationship graph analysis, how would you proceed?

**Tip:**  
For each question, use the STAR method in your response: briefly describe the Situation, your Task, the Action(s) you took, and the Result or impact. Where possible, quantify improvements and mention specific technologies, algorithms, or workflows you implemented.
