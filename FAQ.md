1. why need ml post rule based?

Great question! While the rule-based scores (`rule_score`, `name_match_score`, `occupation_flag`) do provide an initial measure of PEP risk, here’s why adding a machine learning (ML) model on top is beneficial:

### Limitations of simply summing the rule-based scores:
- **Rules are often binary/simple:** Rules typically capture only clear yes/no conditions or fixed thresholds (e.g., name similarity ≥ 85). Summing may miss more subtle patterns.
- **Non-linear relationships:** The interaction between features might not be additive. For example, a moderate name similarity combined with a non-high-risk occupation but from a high-risk country might still imply risk. ML models can capture these complex, non-linear relationships.
- **Incorporating additional features:** ML models can leverage other customer attributes (like encoded nationality or occupation, as in the example) alongside rule results — something a simple sum can’t handle effectively.
- **Reducing false alerts:** Pure rule-based systems tend to produce many false positives (flags that don’t truly correspond to PEPs). ML models can learn patterns from labeled data to weigh signals optimally, thus reducing false alerts.
- **Confidence scores/probabilities:** ML models output probabilities that represent nuanced confidence levels about PEP status rather than crude scores, helping prioritize investigations better.
- **Handling noisy or incomplete info:** ML can be more robust in cases where data is inconsistent or partial, by learning from overall patterns.

### In summary:
- The rule-based score provides **interpretable, expert-driven initial risk signals**.
- The ML model **learns how to combine those signals and other data features optimally**, improving accuracy and confidence estimation.
- Together, they create a **hybrid system that balances expert rules with data-driven learning**, boosting detection performance and reducing false positives.

If you want a strictly rule-based system, summing or weighted sums of rule flags can be a start, but adding ML helps significantly when you want to scale, generalize, and improve precision.

Would you like me to help you build a version that only sums rule scores or design a weighting scheme?
